##Project Euler Problems in Clojure

This project contains implementations for solving problems from the well-known
programming problem site https://projecteuler.net/

While this project will contain answers to problems, it is not intended to be used for cheating.

This project is intended as an educational tool for all involved and is not intended to 
necessarily contain the most efficient solution (problem 1 for instance) but should be able to be 
followed relatively easily by those who are new to Clojure.

I hope that somebody finds it useful.
