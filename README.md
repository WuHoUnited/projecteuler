##Project Euler Problems in Clojure

This repository is intended as a learning experience for all involved.
While this repository will contain answers to problems, it is not intended to be used for cheating.
It is also not intended to necessarily contain the most efficient solution (problem 1 for instance)
but should be able to be followed relatively easily by those who are now to Clojure.
I hope that somebody finds it useful.
